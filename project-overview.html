        <p style="margin: 0 0 12px 0; color: #444;">This project begins with an examination of everyday food access in New York City, focusing on how food consumption, pricing, and household practices are shaped by economic pressure and urban living conditions. By looking beyond individual choices to citywide patterns of food prices, restaurant density, and daily food practices, the research situates everyday eating within broader systems that structure access, affordability, and environmental impact across neighborhoods.</p>
        <p>Through spatial analysis and index-based mapping, the project explores how food-related vulnerability is distributed across the city. A Food Vulnerability Index was developed as an exploratory tool, combining normalized measures of restaurant density, household food storage capacity, and poverty. While this analysis revealed uneven patterns of vulnerability, it also exposed the limits of conventional food access metrics. In several cases, neighborhoods that appeared relatively stable at the residential scale were deeply entangled in the infrastructural systems that sustain food access citywide, suggesting that vulnerability cannot be fully understood through consumption- or access-based indicators alone.</p>
        <p>These findings prompted a shift in focus from consumption endpoints to the logistical and infrastructural systems that enable everyday food access. The project turned toward food logistics and cold chain operations as critical but often invisible components of urban climate infrastructure. Concentrated freight traffic, large-scale refrigeration facilities, and continuous distribution networks support citywide food availability while generating localized environmental and health burdens. This pivot reframes urban food systems not only as sites of access and consumption, but as infrastructural systems through which climate impacts and exposures are unevenly produced across the city.</p>
